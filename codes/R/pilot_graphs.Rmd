This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/fatma/OneDrive/Desktop/IITK BOOKS/Decision Making/DM Project/data/All data - Average_error.csv")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
View(data)
```

```{r}
# Check the structure of the data
str(data)

# Compute the correlation between 'error' and 'O-life'
cor(data$error, data$O.life)

# Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot
plot(data$error, data$O.life, xlab = "Error", ylab = "O-life")
abline(lm(data$O.life ~ data$error), col = "red")

```
```{r}
# Compute the correlation between 'error' and 'O-life'
cor_test <- cor.test(data$error, data$O.life)

# Print the results
print(cor_test)

```

```{r}
# Check the structure of the data
str(data)

# Compute the correlation between 'error' and 'O-life'
cor(data$error, data$Unusual.Experiences)

# Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot
plot(data$error, data$O.life, xlab = "Error", ylab = "O-life")
abline(lm(data$O.life ~ data$error), col = "red")

cor_test <- cor.test(data$error, data$Unusual.Experiences)

# Print the results
print(cor_test)
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
